A Markov Random Field (MRF) model based image cleaner.

Note: This code was developed towards an assignment for the Machine Learning
course at Boston University. Refer to 'p5.pdf' for more details.

Part A:
Run ps5a.m file.
h=-0.01; b=5; n=3; With these parameter values, accuracy achieved was 99.79%.
Original Image - results/a/orig.png
Processed Image - results/a/final.png

Part B:
Run ps5b.m file.
Original Image - results/b/orig.png
Processed Image - results/b/final.png
No clear notion of accuracy here, but the resultant image does look relatively cleaner.
